# 🏠 House Price Prediction (ML Project)

This project uses Machine Learning to predict house prices based on various features such as the size, quality, and location of the property. The model was built using Linear Regression and trained on a dataset of real estate listings.

## 📌Project Highlights

- **Model Used**: Linear Regression
- **Evaluation Metric**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- **Platform**: Google Colab
- **Purpose**: To understand and implement basic regression techniques in machine learning

## 🔧 Workflow

1. **Data Import**: Dataset loaded using Pandas.
2.  **Preprocessing**:
   - Categorical variables encoded
   - Missing values handled
3. **Model Training**: Linear Regression model trained on selected features.
4. **Evaluation**: MAPE used to compare predicted vs actual prices.
5. **Prediction**: Model used to predict price of a new house based on input features.

## 🧪 Sample Output

```text
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 0.18
Actual Price: ₹180,921
Predicted Price: ₹191,650
